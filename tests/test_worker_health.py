"""Tests for the distributed worker health loop's spec-poll throttling.

Regression coverage for S1 finding 3: spec polling used cfg.last_check (rewritten
every health cycle) as its throttle, so `now - last_check` was always small and
the spec poll never fired. The loop now keeps a dedicated per-device timestamp.

# --- ADR-0015 / F-69: the OpenAPI declared dimension -------------------------
#
# Found by live-testing ADR-0015 on a cluster, not by the unit suite: `_last_declared`
# was only ever written inside the `mcp` branch of `_check_reachability`, so an OpenAPI
# device — the DEFAULT upstream kind — had no declared identity at all. Its consequences
# are quiet ones: `key_and_declared_changed` (ADR-0015 §3's strongest signal) could never
# fire for such a device, and the inventory metadata the ADR names as a motive was absent.
# The evidence that made it undeniable was a spec declaring title "TLS Probe Test Device"
# version "9.9.9" against a device reporting declared_name=None.
