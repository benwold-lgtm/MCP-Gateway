"""Streamable HTTP inbound, embedded mode (Phase 6, Workstream A1).

End-to-end against a real server and the mock target API, not a mocked pod. The transport's
whole point is that the JSON-RPC response comes back on the POST that carried the request,
and a mocked pod would let the test agree with the implementation about that rather than
check it — the failure mode this project keeps hitting.

Nothing here pre-seeds a session: every test that needs one gets it by performing a real
`initialize`, so the cold path (a first request from a client with no session) is the path
under test rather than the one skipped.
