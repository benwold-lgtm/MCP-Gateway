"""XREAD BLOCK against the connection's socket read deadline.

Found on the live cluster, not here: a Streamable HTTP call to a device whose worker was
frozen returned **500** after 32s instead of the 504 the code intends. The cause is that
``XREAD BLOCK`` holds the connection with the server silent until the window elapses, so a
socket read timeout less than or equal to the block window fires *first* — every time, not
occasionally. Shipped defaults were ``block=5000ms`` against ``socket_timeout=5``: exactly
equal, and 6/6 idle reads raised when measured in-cluster.

The existing real-Redis tier could not catch it because its ``real_redis`` fixture builds a
client with **no** ``socket_timeout``, while ``create_redis`` sets one. So these tests build
their client the way production does — that difference is the entire bug, and a fixture that
smooths it over is how it survived to a cluster.
