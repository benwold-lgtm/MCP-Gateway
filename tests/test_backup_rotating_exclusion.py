"""ADR-0018 §3 — the gateway-minted refresh token is excluded from every archive.

Three properties, and each is tested by the thing that would let it through.

**The token is gone from the archive, not merely from the field it lived in.** The headline
test registers an OAuth2 device through the **real embedded registration path** and greps
the whole serialised archive for the token string — the same standard
``test_backup_export`` set for the mode-independence property, and for the same reason. A
test that asserted ``payload["refresh_token"] is None`` would pass on an implementation that
left a copy in ``extra_params``, in a nested block, or in a second device's record.

**Excluding it must cost the devices it does not apply to nothing.** ``client_credentials``
and ``password`` devices also receive rotated refresh tokens from providers, and for them
the token is disposable — the operator-provisioned ``client_secret`` or ``password`` is
still what authenticates. Reporting those as needing a human would be a false alarm on a
device that restores seamlessly, so the discrimination is tested directly rather than
assumed from the strip.

**The one real cost must be visible, not discovered.** A ``grant_type=refresh_token`` device
arrives from a restore registered, reachable, correctly fingerprinted and unable to
authenticate. The ADR's standard is that it must not look restored and fail on its first
tool call — so the tests assert the restore *report* says so, and that the device's own
status still says so afterwards, on the **list** projection and not only the detail view.
That last part is a defect ``fingerprint_state`` already has and this field must not inherit.
