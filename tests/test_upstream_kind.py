"""Phase 2 of the MCP-passthrough plan — the entity model.

A remote MCP server is registered as a ``DeviceConfig``, not a new entity type, discriminated
by two fields: ``upstream_kind`` (what the upstream *speaks*) and ``upstream_transport``
(how we *talk* to it). Reusing the device entity is the decision that keeps a future
multitenancy retrofit to one set of keys, routes and metrics instead of two.

Two things can go wrong here, and neither is caught by a happy-path round-trip:

1. **Adding a field to a persisted record breaks the records already stored.** A Redis hash
   written before this change has no ``upstream_kind`` key, and a SQLite ``devices`` table
   created before it has no such column — so an ``INSERT`` naming that column fails outright.
   An existing embedded deployment would come back up unable to save a device. Both are
   tested against a genuinely pre-upgrade artefact rather than a freshly built one.
2. **``transport`` gets overloaded.** It is *inbound* — how the pod serves MCP to its
   clients — and ``api/sse.py`` hard-rejects anything but ``"sse"``. A proxied upstream must
   keep ``transport="sse"``; ``upstream_transport`` is the separate outbound field. Conflating
   them looks harmless right up to the point where a registered MCP upstream cannot be
   connected to at all.
