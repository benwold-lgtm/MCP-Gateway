"""A deleted device must stay deleted, even while a worker is still writing to it.

Found on the lab cluster 2026-08-10. ``DELETE /v1/devices/{h}`` removed the record and
dropped the hostname from ``devices:all``; a worker that still had the device assigned
then wrote ``pod_active``/``worker_id``, and a plain ``HSET`` **re-created the hash** with
only those two fields. The wreckage was invisible to ``GET /v1/devices`` (which reads the
set) while every read *by hostname* raised ``KeyError: 'hostname'`` as a 500 — and
re-registering that hostname failed too, since registration reads the device first.

The tests that matter here run against a **real Redis**, and they perform the actual
sequence rather than pre-seeding a partial hash: a pre-seeded fixture would prove the
decoder tolerates wreckage while saying nothing about whether the write path still
creates it. ``MemoryRegistryBackend`` never had the bug (it guards with ``if cfg``),
which is why the embedded suite could not have caught this — so the parity test below
pins both backends to the same contract.
