"""One place that builds Redis key names (Phase 0 of the MCP-passthrough plan).

Every Redis key was an inline f-string at its call site — ~70 of them across 12 modules,
with no prefixing helper. That is fine today and expensive later: if in-application
multitenancy is ever adopted, a tenant prefix has to be threaded through every one of them,
and each edit is an opportunity to orphan live control-plane data. Routing them through one
builder makes that a single change, and makes "several cheap cells sharing one Redis under
different prefixes" a viable deployment in the meantime.

The tests below exist in a specific order of importance:

1. **Byte-for-byte parity.** A builder that renames a key silently orphans whatever is
   already in Redis under the old name — live device config, claims, dead letters. The
   explicit literal table is the guard, and it is deliberately written out by hand rather
   than generated from the builders, because a table generated from the code under test
   would agree with a rename.
2. **Uniform prefixing**, which is the property the refactor exists to buy.
3. **No inline key f-strings left behind**, so the seam does not erode.
