"""Fleet over Streamable HTTP, embedded mode (Phase 6, Workstream A3).

End-to-end against a real server and the mock target API. Two devices share the same mock
API, so the same tool exists on both and must come back correctly namespaced — the fleet's
whole job.

The headline assertion is that **``tools/call`` answers on the POST**. On the SSE fleet
surface the result arrives on a stream instead, and the two modes disagree about which
methods do that; here there is no stream, so a test that finds the result in the response
body is checking the thing this workstream exists to deliver.

Nothing is pre-seeded: every session is opened by a real ``initialize``.
