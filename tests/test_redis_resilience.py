"""Redis client failover resilience (third-party review item 6).

``create_redis`` used to pass only ``socket_timeout`` and ``max_connections``. With no
``retry``, ``retry_on_error``, ``health_check_interval`` or ``socket_connect_timeout``, a
primary failover surfaced to callers as a burst of hard ``ConnectionError``s rather than a
transparent reconnect — so even a correctly built HA Redis did not actually buy HA.

These tests assert the *policy semantics* (does a transient failure recover? does a
permanent one still surface?), not merely that the kwargs are present.
