"""Guard against requirements.txt drifting from pyproject.toml (S2 finding F2).

requirements.txt is the pip-compiled lockfile used by the Docker image. It had
silently gone stale — missing redis/slowapi/pybreaker — so a clean install from
it produced an environment that couldn't import the app. This test fails if any
declared runtime dependency is absent from the lockfile.
