"""ADR-0018 §3 — a restore must say when this stack cannot resolve a reference.

§3 states it as a consequence: restoring into a different stack "requires that stack to be
able to resolve the references, which is an honest and visible failure rather than a silent
one." It was neither. ``restore.py`` never touched the resolver, so a device whose
``credential_ref`` the target could not resolve was reported ``restored`` and failed at its
first tool call — the same shape as a device that looks restored and cannot authenticate,
one field over from the condition §3 spends most of its length preventing.

**The property under test is the two failure kinds staying two.** ADR-0018 §7 draws the line
and the resolver already encodes it: a ``ReferenceInvalid`` is one device's problem, a
``StoreUnavailable`` is the fleet's. An unmounted secret store reported as N independent bad
references is the exact misdiagnosis §7 is written against — it sends an operator to check N
references when the actual fault is one volume. So the store case is asserted to produce
**no** per-device results at all, not merely a different message.

**Why this is a warning and not a persistent device field.** *Needs reconnecting* is durable
because only a human supplying a credential clears it. A missing secret is different: it is
fixed by putting the secret in the store, and nothing tells the gateway that happened, so a
stored flag would go stale and start lying. The restore reports it; the device's own dispatch
path reports it thereafter.
