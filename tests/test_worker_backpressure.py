"""Tests for worker backpressure and graceful shutdown (SRE #4/#5/#6).

#4 — undeliverable calls are dead-lettered (not silently XACK-dropped); call
     streams are bounded by MAXLEN.
#5 — per-device concurrency cap: the consume loop blocks on a semaphore when
     saturated instead of spawning unbounded dispatch tasks.
#6 — in-flight tool calls are drained on shutdown before cancellation.
