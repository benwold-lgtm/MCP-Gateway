"""Streamable HTTP for the **fleet** surface (Phase 6, Workstream A3).

One MCP session spanning several devices (ADR-0008), over the transport A1/A2 introduced.
Stands to ``api/fleet.py`` exactly as ``api/streamable.py`` stands to ``api/sse.py``.

**This resolves the inline-vs-stream split.** On the SSE fleet surface, distributed mode
answers ``initialize``/``ping``/``tools/list`` inline on the POST body but returns
``{"status": "accepted"}`` for ``tools/call`` and delivers the real result on the stream —
while embedded mode delivers all four on the stream. Both shapes are legal MCP, but the
asymmetry cost a debugging round and is recorded as a finding in ``docs/testing-gaps.md``.
Here there is no stream to deliver anything on, so **every method answers on the POST that
asked**, identically in both modes. That is the point of the transport, not a bonus.

``tools/call`` reuses the ``ResultExchange`` seam from A1/A2 rather than re-implementing
dispatch: ``fleet_service.rewrite_tools_call`` resolves a namespaced display name to
``(hostname, rewritten)``, and the exchange takes it from there. So the fleet path gets
cross-replica result correlation, admission control and the timeout contract for free, and
there is exactly one implementation of the hard part.
