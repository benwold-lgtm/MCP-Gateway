"""Device CRUD + tools/diagnostics routes.

The register/update input helpers were hoisted out of the ``create_app`` closure in the
router split: they take ``cfg``/``allow_private`` explicitly, with the handlers reading
both from ``request.app.state.config`` per request.

The **validators** then moved again, to ``registry/validation.py`` (F-67). They had made
the egress policy a property of this route rather than of registration itself, which held
only while this route was registration's sole caller — restore is the second one. They are
re-exported below under their original names, so this module reads as it did.

``_parse_auth`` stays here: it turns a *request body* into an ``AbstractAuth``, which is an
HTTP concern. Restore rebuilds its auth from an archived credential blob instead, via
``_auth_from_config`` — the inverse of what persisted it.

    candidate and is worse. It races the health check that pins on first sight, so whether
    the write lands depends on timing, and a security rule whose outcome depends on timing is
    one nobody can reason about at the point of use.
