"""Streamable HTTP inbound transport (Phase 6, Workstream A).

The gateway's only inbound transport has been **HTTP+SSE** — `GET /sse` returning an
`endpoint` event, then `POST /messages?session_id=`. That transport is formally Deprecated
with a removal clock, and `transport != "sse"` is a hard reject elsewhere, so there is no
fallback. Streamable HTTP is owed regardless of whether we adopt revision `2026-07-28`.

**Semantics here are unchanged** — this is revision `2025-06-18` over a different transport.
Sessions still exist. The modern stateless era is Workstream B and lands on top of this.

Deliberately a **separate path** (`/mcp`) rather than content negotiation on `/messages`:
HTTP+SSE is scheduled for removal one minor release after this ships, and a separate path
makes that a deletion rather than an unpicking.

**Both modes are supported.** The mode difference is confined to one function,
``_exchange_for``: in embedded mode the pod is in-process and answering is a call, while in
distributed mode the POST may land on any replica and the answer is produced by a worker and
published to Redis, so the replica waits on ``session:{id}:results`` and correlates by
JSON-RPC id. Everything else in this module is transport, and transport does not care.
