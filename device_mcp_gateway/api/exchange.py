"""Request/response exchange — deliver a JSON-RPC message and return its response *here*.

The existing SSE transport is fire-and-forget at the HTTP layer: a `POST /messages` is
acknowledged, and the JSON-RPC response arrives later on a stream the client already holds
open. Streamable HTTP inverts that — the response belongs to the POST that carried the
request — and that inversion, not the framing, is the actual work.

In embedded mode it is trivial: the pod is in this process, so awaiting it is a call.

In distributed mode it is the hard part of Phase 6, and it is why this seam exists at all.
The POST can land on any gateway replica, while the device is owned by one worker and the
result is published to Redis. The replica handling the POST therefore has to *wait* on a
result it does not produce, correlating by JSON-RPC id — where today it merely publishes the
call and lets whichever replica holds the SSE stream do the delivering.

Defining the boundary now means the distributed implementation is a new subclass rather than
a rewrite of the endpoint that calls it. The endpoints depend on this interface only.
