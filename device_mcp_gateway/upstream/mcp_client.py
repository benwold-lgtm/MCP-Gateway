"""A minimal MCP Streamable HTTP client, built on the gateway's guarded egress.

**Why not the MCP SDK's client.** ``mcp.client.streamable_http`` and ``sse_client`` are
task-group context managers designed to own a connection for the lifetime of a session.
That fights the worker's dispatch model, where a call arrives off a Redis stream and must
be served without a surrounding session scope. More importantly, the SDK builds its own
httpx client through ``create_mcp_http_client``, which defaults ``follow_redirects=True`` —
precisely what ``build_guarded_client(follow_redirects=False)`` prevents on the hot path,
because httpx strips ``Authorization`` across origins but *not* custom auth headers. Using
the SDK would mean either re-deriving that guard or losing it.

What is actually needed is small: one JSON-RPC POST per call. Implementing it directly
keeps every request on the same SSRF-guarded, address-pinned, port-checked, mTLS-capable
client the rest of the gateway uses.

Two response framings are accepted, because the spec allows a server to answer the same
POST either way: a plain JSON body, or a single SSE-framed message.

**Outbound headers are built solely from fixed protocol headers plus ``auth.apply()``.**
Nothing derived from tool arguments ever reaches them — the F-25 header-injection class of
bug cannot occur on this path, and a test pins that it stays that way.
