"""ADR-0017 §8 — revocation interrupts in-flight work, not just future requests.

Deliberately scoped to a single gateway process, not a distributed one. In distributed mode
the gateway API tier itself is horizontally scaled (`docs/kubernetes-architecture.md`) — a
request authenticated by a support grant is handled entirely on the one replica that accepted
the connection, and `revoke_support_grant` (see `api/support_requests.py`) may land on a
*different* replica. Reaching across replicas to cancel a task on another process would need a
durable cross-replica signal (this codebase's own precedent for that,
`shared/session_router.py`'s `SessionRouter`, uses a Redis Stream rather than pub/sub for
exactly this class of problem — a fire-and-forget publish can be missed by a replica that is
mid-restart).

That machinery is not built here, and deliberately so: a call this registry cannot reach still
stops — the request handler is either already past its own bounded timeout logic (F6's
`_watch_tool_call_timeout`) or is refused on its *next* call, since `check`/`check_proof` are
already live-checked per request (no separate signed token to still be valid — see
`support_grants.py`). What this registry buys is the *same-replica* case: a revoke lands on the
very process where the call is still running, and that call is cancelled immediately rather
than left to unwind on its own. That is the common case for a single-stack (embedded-mode)
deployment, and a real improvement — never a regression — everywhere else.
