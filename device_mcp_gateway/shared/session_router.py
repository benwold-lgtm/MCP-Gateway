"""
SSE session registry and result routing via a durable per-session Redis Stream.

In distributed mode every gateway instance is stateless with respect to
SSE clients.  When a client opens a stream on Gateway A and a tool call
arrives at Gateway B, the result still reaches the client because:

  Worker → XADD session:{id}:results <json-rpc-response>
         → Redis Stream (durable, buffered)
         → Gateway A (XREAD BLOCK on session:{id}:results) → SSE event

A Stream rather than pub/sub (SRE #3): pub/sub is fire-and-forget, so a result
published while the single subscribing gateway was mid-restart, briefly
disconnected, or between reads was lost — and because the worker had already
marked the call handled, the F6 timeout watcher stood down too, leaving the
client to hang. A Stream buffers undelivered entries and lets the reader start
from id "0", so results that arrive between register() and subscribe() are not
missed. The stream is bounded (MAXLEN) and carries the session TTL so abandoned
sessions can't leak.

Session keys carry a TTL so abandoned sessions expire automatically.
