    """Create and return a shared async Redis client from config.

    Reads cfg["redis"] for url, socket_timeout, max_connections, and the failover
    resilience knobs (retries, health_check_interval, socket_connect_timeout).
    The MCP_REDIS_URL env var overrides cfg["redis"]["url"].

    Pass max_connections to override the pool size — used for the dedicated
    pub/sub client, which needs one connection per open SSE stream and so must
    be sized well above the command pool.

    **Failover resilience (review item 6).** This used to pass only ``socket_timeout``
    and ``max_connections``, which meant a primary failover reached callers as a burst of
    hard ``ConnectionError``s — pointing the gateway at a properly built HA Redis bought
    almost nothing, because the client never reconnected transparently. Four settings fix
    that, and they only work together:

    - ``retry`` with jittered exponential backoff — absorbs the reconnect burst and a short
      election instead of failing the first command that lands mid-failover. Jitter is the
      important part: a failover hits every replica and worker simultaneously, so
      un-jittered backoff would have them retry in lockstep against the new primary.
    - ``retry_on_error`` — ``retry`` alone governs connection *setup*; this is what lets an
      already-issued command be retried on the new primary.
    - ``health_check_interval`` — a connection left half-open by a failover is otherwise
      only discovered when a real command fails on it, so idle pooled connections would
      each fail once after every failover.
    - ``socket_connect_timeout`` — without it a vanished primary hangs on the OS default
      TCP connect timeout, which is far longer than the failover itself.

    Retrying a command can execute it twice when the failure happened after the server
    ran it but before the reply arrived. That is deliberate and safe here: the rate-limit
    ``INCR`` merely over-counts (fails closed), and dispatch writes are already covered by
    the worker's idempotency guard (``registry.idempotency_guard``, on by default). A
    permanent outage still surfaces — the retry budget is finite, so readiness probes and
    alerting still see a genuinely dead Redis.

    The per-command ``retry`` budget configured above is deliberately short (~2.5 s) — it is
    sized for a failover mid-request, where blocking a caller any longer is worse than failing
    them. Startup is the opposite situation: nobody is waiting on a response, and the usual
    reason Redis is unreachable is that it simply has not finished starting yet.

    Without this, the first command a process issued propagated its ``ConnectionError`` out of
    ``asyncio.run`` as an unhandled traceback and the process exited non-zero. On Kubernetes
    that is *survivable* — kubelet restarts it and it eventually succeeds — but it is not
    harmless: it presents as ``CrashLoopBackOff`` with a stack trace, which reads as a broken
    deployment rather than an ordering wait, and the restart counter it leaves behind is the
    same signal an operator uses to spot real crashes. Observed on a live cluster as two
    restarts per worker before anything worked.
