"""The single place Redis key names are built.

Every key used to be an inline f-string at its call site — around seventy of them across a
dozen modules, with no helper and no shared vocabulary. Nothing was wrong with that while
one deployment owns one Redis. It becomes expensive the moment that stops being true: a
tenant or cell prefix would have to be threaded through every one, and each edit is a chance
to rename a key and silently orphan whatever is already stored under the old name — live
device config, claim leases, dead letters.

Routing them through one builder makes that a single change. It also makes a cheaper
intermediate deployment possible without any application change: several small stacks
sharing one Redis under different prefixes.

**The prefix is an explicit constructor argument, deliberately.** There is no ambient or
request-scoped prefixing — no contextvar, no global mutation. Implicit scoping is the part
that is hard to audit (you cannot tell from a call site which keyspace you are in) and hard
to remove if the tenancy model goes a different way. An explicit argument is legible and
costs nothing to delete.

Two things that live here but are deliberately *not* prefixed, because they are not keys:

- **Consumer group names.** A group is scoped to its stream, so prefixing one is meaningless
  at best. At worst it creates a *second* group on the same stream, and every message gets
  delivered to both — silent duplicate execution.
- **``device://`` resource URIs.** These are handed to MCP clients and may be cached by
  them. They are part of the external contract, not the keyspace.
