"""Restore a backup archive (ADR-0011).

Restoring is not the inverse of exporting, and the difference is the whole design.

**Nothing is written until the entire archive has been decrypt-tested.** The preflight
opens the canary and then every credential in the archive; any failure aborts everything.
A partial apply is the outcome worth the most trouble to avoid — it leaves a registry
half-migrated between two key generations, with no record of where the boundary fell. The
canary is what makes the check total: an archive of devices that all use ``auth_type:
none`` has no credential ciphertext, so without it a wrong-key restore would sail through
and fail at the far end.

The preflight differs by kind on purpose. A ciphertext archive is tested against this
stack's ``MCP_SECRET_KEY`` — a key mismatch is *the* expected failure and is named as such.
A portable archive is tested against the passphrase only, because it is key-independent by
design; demanding the target's key for one would defeat the reason it exists.

**Each device is replayed through the ordinary registration path**, gates and all
(``validate_device_registration``, F-67), never a raw Redis write. That is a security
property rather than tidiness: a ``backup:write`` holder must not be able to reinstate a
device the current egress policy forbids. It follows that a restore can legitimately fail
*on a device*, and those failures are reported per device rather than swallowed or
escalated into a failed batch.

**A restore re-establishes endpoint fingerprints but never re-pins one** (ADR-0015).
Registration starts a device unpinned, and an unpinned device trusts whatever answers
first — so without the archived pin every device would silently re-TOFU on restore and the
control would be void from the first disaster recovery onward, precisely when nobody is in
a position to notice. Where the archive and a live record disagree, the live pin stays and
the disagreement is reported: the archived value is historical, while the live one was
established against the endpoint as it is now, quite possibly by an audited human approval.
See :func:`plan_fingerprint_restore`.

``dry_run=True`` is the default. The destructive direction is never the one you get by
omission — and a dry run runs the same preflight and the same per-device gates, so its
report is a real prediction rather than a parse.

**A restore can succeed and still leave a device unable to authenticate** (ADR-0018 §3). An
OAuth2 refresh token is excluded from every archive, and for ``grant_type=refresh_token`` that
token *was* the credential — so the device comes back registered, reachable, correctly
fingerprinted, and unable to get a token until a human re-authorizes it. That is reported as
its own outcome and left behind as its own persistent device state, because the failure this
design exists to prevent is a device that looks restored and fails on its first tool call.

**And the same is true of a credential reference this stack cannot resolve** (ADR-0018 §3,
which asks for "an honest and visible failure rather than a silent one"). The restore now
resolves every archived ``credential_ref`` before writing anything, so the dry run reports it
while the restore can still be stopped. It is a *warning* rather than an outcome, and
deliberately not a persistent device field: unlike *needs reconnecting* — which only a human
supplying a credential can clear — a missing secret is fixed by putting it in the store, and a
flag recording its absence would go stale the moment somebody did. See
:func:`plan_credential_refs`, which also keeps §7's two failure kinds apart.
