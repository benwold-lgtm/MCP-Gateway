"""Build a backup archive from a live registry (ADR-0011).

What goes in, and why the list is short
---------------------------------------
**Included** — the device registry and the governance record of how each device's tool
surface last changed (``device:{h}:tools_change``, deliberately un-TTL'd because it is the
one thing here with no other source of truth).

**Opt-in** — dead letters. Valuable mid-incident, unbounded noise otherwise.

**Excluded on purpose** — everything reconstructible or ephemeral: claims and leases,
worker membership, assignment and call streams, sessions, idempotency markers, rate-limit
counters, the TTL'd manifest cache. Restoring a stale claim or a half-consumed stream would
actively harm a fresh stack, so the omission is a feature, not a gap.

Per device the archive carries **registration inputs**, not runtime state. ``pod_active``,
``reachable``, ``last_check``, ``worker_id`` and ``spec_hash`` are all measurements of a
particular running stack and mean nothing in another one — restoring them would assert
facts about a fleet that has not been contacted yet, which is exactly the mistake F-66 was.
The restoring stack establishes them itself.

The one apparent exception is the endpoint fingerprint (ADR-0015), and it proves the rule.
A pin looks like a measurement — something a probe observed — but it is a **baseline
somebody is trusting**, in the same family as ``tools_revision``: TOFU established it, or a
human approved it, and either way it encodes a decision rather than a reading. So it
travels. Dropping it would not lose a fact the new stack can re-derive; it would silently
re-run trust-on-first-use against whatever now answers at ``base_url`` — the exact
substitution the control exists to catch, at the exact moment nobody is watching.

The credential field
--------------------
The archive's ``auth_config`` is always **ciphertext under whatever seals this archive** —
the stack's ``MCP_SECRET_KEY`` for a ciphertext archive, the passphrase-derived key for a
portable one. That invariant needs stating because the two modes do not store credentials
the same way:

- **Distributed** encrypts before writing to Redis (``Registry._register_distributed``).
- **Embedded** stores ``DeviceConfig.auth_config`` as **plaintext JSON** — encryption
  happens a layer lower, in the SQLite store.

So exporting the stored value verbatim would produce a genuine ciphertext archive on one
mode and a plaintext credential dump on the other, from the same "safe by default" call.
Normalising here is what makes the archive's security property independent of the mode it
came from, and a ciphertext export with no key configured is **refused** rather than
quietly downgraded.
