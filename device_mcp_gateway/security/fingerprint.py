"""Endpoint fingerprinting — pin what a device *is* (ADR-0015, F-69).

Three dimensions, deliberately never collapsed into one "verified" flag:

* **Authenticated** — the TLS **SPKI** digest. Cryptographic; proves this is the same
  endpoint as last time.
* **Declared** — MCP ``serverInfo`` / OpenAPI ``info``. Self-reported, therefore spoofable.
  Inventory that doubles as a change signal, never evidence of identity.
* **Behavioural** — ``canonical_tools_hash`` / ``tools_revision``, which already exist.

Why SPKI and not the certificate
--------------------------------
A routine renewal re-issues the certificate against the **same key**, so the SPKI is
unchanged and nothing fires. Pinning the certificate digest would alarm on every ACME
renewal — every 60-90 days, for every device — and
[ADR-0013 §8]'s argument applies unchanged: a control that fires constantly trains people
to approve reflexively, which destroys the signal exactly where it needs to mean something.
A *changed key* is indistinguishable from a substituted endpoint, and that is worth an alarm.

What this does not do
---------------------
The first observation is **trust on first use**: it establishes a baseline, it does not
validate anything. If the endpoint was already the wrong one at registration, the wrong
value is what gets pinned. Nothing here should be described as verifying identity.
